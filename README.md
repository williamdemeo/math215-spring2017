Introduction
------------
You are now reading the main course web page.
The paragraphs below serve as the syllabus for Math 215 Sections 1, 2, 3.

*This page, as well as the content of the class github repository, will
 be updated frequently throughout the semester. Students are expected to visit this
 page often to stay informed about the class.* 

Please bookmark this page or, better yet,

 page to yourself!

The UH Laulima system will be used only for recording test scores and
grades. Please Note, the Laulima may report cumulative grade totals
that bear little relation to the course grades as they will be computed at
the end of the semester. If you want to find out where you stand in the class,
please keep track of your grades and refer to the
[Grading Policy](#grading-policy) section below.

5. Exponential and Logarithmic Functions  
6. Integration  

**Prerequisites**  
Prerequisite: Math 140 or satisfactory performance on placement exam.

**Learning Outcomes**  
Generally speaking, students will master concepts and solve problems based on
functions, limits, derivatives, introductory integrals, the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus, and applications of derivatives and integrals. For a more detailed
list of the course objectives, see the appendix section 
[Detailed Course Objectives](#detailed-course-objectives) below, or see the Math
Department's generic [Math 215 webpage](https://math.hawaii.edu/wordpress/course/215/).

Textbook Information
--------------------
**Title:** *Calculus for the Life Sciences* (2015)  
**Authors:** Raymond N. Greenwell, Nathan P. Ritchey, Margaret L. Lial  
**Edition:** 2nd  

**Important Note:** Students are required to have a
[MyMathLabs][] access code in order to complete the online homework for this
course. It is also highly recommended that students have a hard copy of the
textbook, so it's a good idea to buy the bundled version of the
book from the bookstore, which comes with both a hard copy of
the book and a MyMathLab access code.

Having said that, the version of the textbook is not very important.
What matters most is that every student has access to MyMathLabs.

For reference, the textbook used by your instructor of this class is the 2nd edition of
"Calculus for the Life Sciences," published in 2015. However, the subject of
calculus has not changed very much in the last 50 years, and the content of this
course is *very* standard.  Thus, there is a very wide variety of good calculus
books that one could learn from, and some of the older editions are probably available 
on the shelves of the library.  Of course, it's easier to follow along with the class
if you have a copy of the same book that the instructor is using.

For your reference, here are links to the MyMathLabs for this class:

Exams
-----
There will be three midterm exams each worth 15%, and a final exam worth
25% of the course grade.

+ **MIDTERM EXAM 1** (focus on Chapters 1--3)  
**DATE:** TBD  
**TIME:** your usual recitation meeting time.  
**LOCATION:** your usual recitation classroom.
  
+ **MIDTERM EXAM 2** (focus on Chapters 4--6)  
**DATE:** TBD  
**TIME:** your usual recitation meeting time.  
**LOCATION:** your usual recitation classroom.

+ **MIDTERM EXAM 3** (focus on Chapters 7--9)  
**DATE:** Tuesday, November 17.  
**TIME:** your usual recitation meeting time.  
**LOCATION:** your usual recitation classroom.

+ **FINAL EXAM** on Chapters 1--9 and 11.  
**DATE:** Monday, May 8, 2017.  
**TIME:** 12:00--14:00.  
**LOCATION:** Bilger 150.

The final exam will be cumulative, that is, it will cover everything we have
learned during the semester.

In accordance with university policy, the final exam is mandatory and must be
taken by all students at the scheduled time. Do not make travel plans before
the date of the final exam.  There are **no make-up final exams** for any reason.

Quizzes
-------
There will be approximately 11 short quizzes, administered
roughly once per week during recitation.

**NO MAKE-UP QUIZZES.**  
*Under no circumstances will there be any make-up quizzes.*
To accommodate circumstances that cause a student to miss a quiz,
the lowest quiz score will be dropped at the end of the semester.
The remaining quizzes will account for 10% of the final course grade.

Online Homework
---------------
Solving lots of problems is the best way to prepare yourself to do well on the
tests and quizzes, and ultimately to do well in the course.

The **online homework will account for 15% of the course grade** and will be
assigned once per week, typically due each Friday by midnight.

All homework for this course will be done with [MyMathLab][].
You will enroll yourself in our course by going to the 
[MyMathLab website][] and using the following class key:

**MyMathLab Class Key:** TBA

The problems assigned and the due dates will be clearly indicated on the
MyMathLab website, so students must login frequently and check for newly
assigned homework. (The last assignment will be due during the last week
of the semester, also known as "dead week.")  

**Late homework will not be accepted or graded.**  

The lowest homework score will be dropped and not counted toward the final course grade.


Handwritten Homework
--------------------
To get the most out of the homework, and to prepare yourself well for the in-class
(hand-written) tests and exams, it is a very good idea to print out hard copies
of each homework assignment, take these hard copies to a quiet place like the
library, and work on them using a pencil.
Thereafter, you should go through the assignment from the beginning while logged into MyMathLab
and submit your answers, using your handwritten notes and solutions as a guide.  

Hand-written work will not be submitted for grading.
However, for the purpose of asking questions about homework in lecture,
recitation section, or office hours, as well as for studying for exams, it can
be very helpful to have printed out hard copies of all the homework assignments.


Make-up Policy
--------------
**There are no make-up homework or quizzes for any reason.**  If you must miss
a quiz or you fail to submit homework on time, this will not necessarily hurt
your course grade since the lowest quiz and homework scores will be dropped.

Generally speaking, there are no make-up exams. However, 
if you must miss an exam for one of the legitimate reasons listed below,
and if you contact the professor at least five days before the exam date,
then you might be able to take a make-up exam *before* the scheduled exam time.

To request a make-up exam, a student must provide documented evidence of
one of the following:

+ Medical excuse - student's own medical emergency.
+ Medical excuse - a member of the student's family has a medical emergency.
+ Extra curricular activities as a representative of University of Hawaii.
+ Armed forces deployment (military duty).
+ Officially mandated court appearances, including jury duty.

If you miss an exam due to some unforeseen circumstance, you must contact the 
professor within one class meeting after the missed test and provide an
explanation. If your excuse is accepted, the missed test score may be replaced 
with 80% of your final exam score. For example, if your excuse is accepted and
you score a 90% on the final, then you will receive a 72% for the missed test
(0.80*0.90 = 0.72).


Grading Policy
--------------
The breakdown of the final course grade is as follows:  

+ Final exam: 30 points  
+ Mid-term exams: 45 points (15 each)  
+ Homework: 15 points total  
+ Quizzes/Recitation Grade: 10 points

At the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned roughly according to
the following table. However, the scale may be shifted,
depending on overall student performance.  All curving (if any)
will occur at the end of the semester.  

+ A: 94--100  
+ A-: 91--93  
+ B+: 87--90   
+ B: 84--86   
+ B-: 81--83   
+ C+: 77--80  
+ C: 74--76   
+ C-: 71--73   
+ D+: 67--70   
+ D: 64--66   
+ D-: 60--63   
+ F:  0--59    

Attendance
----------
**Students are expected to attend all classes.**
A grade penalty will be exacted if you have an excessive number of absences
(whether excused or unexcused).
Specifically, you are permitted (but strongly discouraged from taking) seven
absences in total. Each absence in addition
to that may result in the deduction of points from your final grade.

In many of the lectures, attendance will be recorded by passing around a sign-in
sheet on which you will print and sign your own name. (If another student asks
you to sign in for them, don't do it! Forging another student's signature
constitutes a violation of the student code of conduct and will be referred to
the dean's office or the university's office of judicial affairs.)

Leaving Class Early
-------------------
If you plan to leave before class is over, the correct procedure is to mention
this to the professor before the start of class. It is impolite and disruptive
to your classmates to leave, or even pack up your belongings, before the lecture
is over.


3 Ways to Ask Questions
-----------------------

When you don't understand something, please ask a question!

1. **Lecture** The best time/place to ask a question is during lecture or recitation or office hours.

2. **Piazza** Another good place to ask a question is online discussion forum.
   This term we will be using 
   [Piazza](https://piazza.com/hawaii/spring2017/math215/home) 
   for class discussion and all students
   should enroll in this forum by visiting the 
   [Piazza signup page](https://piazza.com/hawaii/spring2017/math215).

   [Piazza](https://piazza.com/hawaii/spring2017/math215/home) 
   system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from
   the TA, professor, and your peers. Rather than emailing questions to the
   teaching staff, students are encouraged to post questions on Piazza forum.
   If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email
   [team@piazza.com](mailto:team@piazza.com). 

   The following is a link to our Piazza page:
   
   https://piazza.com/hawaii/spring2017/math215

3. **MyMathLab** Another way to ask a question is by using the "Ask my instructor" link on
   MyMathLab. This method is convenient for the teaching staff because details
   about the problem you're asking about are automatically embedded 
   in your email.

   *Please note:* if you use the "Ask my instructor" button, your
   question may be reposted on our [Piazza][] forum (which is public).  If you're
   uncomfortable with this, please say so in your message.


Email Policy
------------
You may email the instructor and TAs directly, though the response
time will generally be slower than if you use one of the preferred methods
described above.

If you email the instructor, you *must* use an informative subject field.
If you use <a href="mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com?subject=MATH 215:
(fill in subject line here)&amp;body=Dear Dr. DeMeo, (your message) Sincerely, (your full name)">this
link</a>  to email the professor, then some of the required information should
pre-populate your message fields.  If you do not at least
indicate which class you are in, your email may be ignored.


Use of Electronics During Lecture
---------------------------------
Silence and refrain from using all electronic devices (phones, ipods, tablets,
microwave ovens, etc.) during class and exam periods.  The only exception to
this policy is the use of computers or tablets for the purpose of referring to
an electronic copy of the textbook, or the online (WebAssign) homework
problems. Using a computer during lecture to check Facebook, for
example, is totally unacceptable. Besides how this affects your own ability to
focus on what is being taught in the lecture, computers can be very distracting 
to other students. **Use of electronic devices in lecture for purposes unrelated
to calculus will not be tolerated.**


Academic Honesty
----------------
Cheating will not be tolerated. Violations of this policy will be referred to
and dealt with by the Dean's Office or the University's Office of Judicial
Affairs, in a  manner consistent with university regulations, which range from a
warning to expulsion from the university.




KOKUA Program (for students needing special accommodations)
----------------------------------------------------------
If you have a documented disability or if you believe that you have a disability
that qualifies under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act and requires accommodations, you should contact the Kokua
Office, which provides resources for students with disabilities, for information
on appropriate policies and procedures. 

[Kokua Program](http://www.hawaii.edu/kokua/)  
Queen Lili'uokalani Center for Student Services 013   
2600 Campus Road   
Honolulu, Hawaii 96822  

Website: [www.hawaii.edu/kokua/](http://www.hawaii.edu/kokua/)    
Phone: (808) 956-7511  
Email: [kokua@hawaii.edu](mailto:kokua@hawaii.edu)  
Hours: Monday--Friday 8am--4pm.

You must have a documented disability to participate in the Kokua Program 
and receive special accommodations for this class, and you should contact Kokua,
as well as your instructor, early in the semester so that your learning needs 
may be appropriately met. 

Your instructor will be happy to assist with accommodations, but will not
provide them retroactively, **so the appropriate requests and paperwork 
should be filed as early as possible,** and must be processed well before the 
first time special accommodation is needed.
